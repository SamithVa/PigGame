# PigGame

In this project, we will build a pig game using only Frond End (HTML, CSS and Javascript).

## What is Pig Game ? 

"Pig" is a simple and fun dice game that involves a bit of strategy and luck, and it's great for two players. 
The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points or other value set by the player.

## Rules of Pig Game

Turns: Players take turns to roll the die as many times as they choose on each turn.

Scoring: Each roll is added to a turn total, but if the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and their turn total is lost.

Holding: At any point during their turn, a player may choose to "hold". When a player holds, the turn total (the sum of the dice rolls during that turn) is added to their overall score.

Winning: The game continues until one of the players reaches or exceeds 100 points.
